### Suspension sensor diagonalization for SOS optics

 - `SUSdiagUtils.py` contains several functions that are useful for downloading data and doing the signal processing.
 - `susDiag.py` works through the diagonalization for the parameters specified in the parameter file.
 - `paramFiles/params_MC2.yml` is an example of the parameter style file that is accepted.
 - `paramFiles/initParams.yml` contains the initial guesses of the positions of the resonant frequencies for the 40m SOS optics.
